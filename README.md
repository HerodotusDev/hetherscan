# Hetherscan

> Hetherscan is a superset of [Betherscan](https://github.com/tiagofneto/betherscan) by [tiagofneto](https://github.com/tiagofneto), focusing on adding Diamond Contract support and various ways to interact with the [Herodotus Storage Proofs API](https://docs.herodotus.cloud/storage-proofs-api/introduction) from within the block explorer.

Hetherscan is a browser extension designed to enhance the user experience on block explorer platforms. By integrating additional information directly into the pages, Hetherscan aims to provide a more comprehensive view of blockchain data, making it easier for developers and advanced users to gather all the information they need without the need to navigate away from the explorer.

## Features

Hetherscan adds new data fields & features to various sections of block explorers, detailed as follows:

### Accounts

#### Smart Contracts

- **Storage root**: Root of the [storage Trie](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie#storage-trie)
- **Code hash**: Keccak256 hash of the EVM code of the account
- **üõ∞Ô∏è Prove Account Properties**: Select the properties you want to prove and prove them with [Herodotus Storage Proofs API](https://docs.herodotus.cloud/storage-proofs-api/introduction) with a single click
- **üõ∞Ô∏è Prove ETH Balance**: Prove the ETH balance of the account with [Herodotus Storage Proofs API](https://docs.herodotus.cloud/storage-proofs-api/introduction)
- **üõ∞Ô∏è Read as Diamond**: Treat the contract as a [Diamond Contract](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) and read any of it's facets' functions
- **üõ∞Ô∏è Write as Diamond**: Treat the contract as a [Diamond Contract](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) and write to any of it's facets' functions
- **üõ∞Ô∏è Diamond Config**: Allows for configuring the function selector and the function name that will be used to get all facet addresses of the Diamond contract (useful for custom Diamond implementations & variations)

#### EOAs

- **Nonce**: Number of transactions sent
- **üõ∞Ô∏è Prove Account Properties**: Select the properties you want to prove and prove them with [Herodotus Storage Proofs API](https://docs.herodotus.cloud/storage-proofs-api/introduction) with a single click
- **üõ∞Ô∏è Prove ETH Balance**: Prove the ETH balance of the account with [Herodotus Storage Proofs API](https://docs.herodotus.cloud/storage-proofs-api/introduction)

### Blocks

- **State root**: Root of the [state Trie](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/#state-trie)
- **Transactions root**: Root of the [transactions Trie](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie#transaction-trie)
- **Receipts root**: Root of the [receipts Trie](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie#receipts-trie)
- **Mix hash**: Used to verify the correctness of a block's Proof of Work. In Proof of Stake consensus, corresponds to the _RANDAO_ value of the previous Beacon Chain block
- **Logs Bloom**: [Bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) of indexable information from the logs entry of the transactions receipts
- **Header RLP**: [RLP](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp) encoded block header
- **üõ∞Ô∏è Prove header properties**: Select the properties you want to prove and prove them with [Herodotus Storage Proofs API](https://docs.herodotus.cloud/storage-proofs-api/introduction) with a single click

### Transactions

- **Signature (v, r, s)**: Components of the digital signature ([ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm)) of the transaction
